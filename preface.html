<h1>Preface</h1>





<p>
<i>Chez&nbsp;Scheme</i> Version&nbsp;9 is a complete implementation of the language of
the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on Scheme (R6RS), with numerous extensions.
The implementation is extensively tested and actively maintained and supported.
It includes a fast compiler that generates efficient native code for each
processor upon which it runs along with a run-time system that provides
automatic storage management, foreign language interfaces, and an
extensive run-time library.

<p>
The compiler has been rewritten for Version&nbsp;9 and generates
substantially faster code than the earlier compiler at the cost of
additional compile time.
This is the primary difference between Versions&nbsp;8 and&nbsp;9.

<p>
This book is a companion to <i>The Scheme Programming Language, 4th
Edition</i> (TSPL4).
While TSPL4 describes only standard R6RS features, this book describes
<i>Chez&nbsp;Scheme</i> extensions.
For the reader's convenience, the summary of forms and index at the back
of this book contain entries from both books, with each entry from TSPL4
marked with a "t" in front of its page number.
In the online version, the page numbers given in the summary of forms and
index double as direct links into one of the documents or the other.

<p>
Additional documentation for <i>Chez&nbsp;Scheme</i> includes release notes, a
manual page, and a number of published papers and articles that describe
various aspects of the system's design and implementation.

<p>
The threaded versions of <i>Chez&nbsp;Scheme</i> support native threads, allowing
Scheme programs to take advantage of multiprocessor or multiple-core
systems. 
Nonthreaded versions are also available and are faster for
single-threaded applications.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available for some platforms.
The 64-bit versions support larger heaps, while the 32-bit versions
are faster for some applications.

<p>
<i>Chez&nbsp;Scheme</i>'s interactive programming system includes an expression
editor that, like many shells, supports command-line editing, a history
mechanism, and command completion.
Unlike most shells that support command-line editing, the expression
editor properly supports multiline expressions.

<p>
Thank you for using <i>Chez&nbsp;Scheme</i>.
